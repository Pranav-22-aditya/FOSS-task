## About me
__Name__: Mitul Varshney
__Enrollment number__: IIT2020145
__Branch__: IT

## Why I want to join the FOSS wing?
Oh, I ain't :sweat_smile: <br>
I have already been selected in __CyberSecurity__ <br>
I am just practicing my __git-fu__ :joy: <br>

## What technologies I have worked in the past?
Programming
- [Processing 3](https://processing.org) - for creative programs
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - to mainly develop [python](https://python.org) projects
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - to mainly develop [python](https://python.org) projects

Web Development
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - haven't used it much, created simple website backend and some [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) stuff
- [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) - used for two very little projects (unpublished)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - to build a few websites

Cyber security
- [Kali Linux](https://kali.org) - using it as my main OS :grin:
  * [pwncat](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat) - to complete most of my [CTF](https://ctftime.org/)s, helps in performing multiple tasks with ease
  * [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) - to act as __MITM__ for the web requests, exploited [Aviral Portal](https://aviral.iiita.ac.in)
  * [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/s/gdb/) - to debug small programs (basically CTF stuff)
  * and more...
  * these are not _technologies_ but _tools_ instead, so I am stopping here but there are a lot of _tools_ in _Kali Linux repo_ :joy:
  * I have only _touched the surface_ :sweat_smile:

> Give or take a few in the above list

**Ask me about the rest...**
